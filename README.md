# One.Beer.Later.


Project Name: One.Beer.Later.

Our Team: -Anthony Mitchell -Jason Paffenback -Taylor Yao

What is this?? The idea behind this is revamp our first project which creates an easy way for a user to identify places within an  determined area that sell/serve CRAFT beer. The results will be displayed on a map and then the user will have the option of letting the site provide directions.

We will be using passport.js, gitkraken and their product management cards, google maps API's, Beer API, mongoDB, react and others 

## How do I use this thing??

Go to the Home page by typing the URL to the version published on Heroku or clicking the link displayed in GitHub. This will take you to the landing page. Enjoy the layout and background picture. No rush, stay as long as you want. Once you are ready for some excitment click "enter". This will bring you to the authentication page. As the user, you will have a few methods of logging in. You can create an account by supplying your email and user name or you can log in using a social media account (Facebook, Github, Twitter, Google). 

Once you are logged in you will be taken to the map page. From here, type the name of any city and see all the locations that serve and or sell craft beer populate on the map. To the right of the map you will see a scrollable list where you can see more detail and contact info. If you are so inclined, there is an "after work" feature that allows a user to see all specials and indicate to the world whether they will attend as well as see who else is attending. This feature is a WIP in hopes that we can pair with local establishments to pass along their specials weekly.
